## Credit
We relied principally on the following references:

For developing the method and R library which we used in our paper:

Thank you:
Anthony Ebert helped write the generate_coronamat function in R, since I was doing it in Python in past versions. He has also pointed out a couple of key bugs in the early codebase. This helped consolidate the code and improved consistency, so thank you Anthony.  Check his GitHub, https://github.com/AnthonyEbert/COVID19data, for an interface to Italy's data and an R package incorporating our code.  

# Dependencies
See Dockerfile.

# Usage
In main.r you can define a list of countries whose relative CFRs you want to compute and plot, and for what dates you would like to compute it.

Rscript main.r -newdata will compute the estimator on the new data defined in the list. Without the -newdata flag, it will just plot based on data cached as a csv in the ./plots folder.
